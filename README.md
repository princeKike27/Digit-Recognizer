# Digit-Recognizer

- Using NumPy Iâ€™m going to build a Neural Network that classifies Hand Written Digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of thousands of handwritten digits and is used for training image processing systems. I will create the Neural Network Architecture, perform Forward Propagation, find the Gradients of the Parameters using Backward Propagation, find the best parameters using Gradient Descent and get the Predictions and Accuracy of the Neural Network.
