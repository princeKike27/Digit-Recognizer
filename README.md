# Digit-Recognizer

- Using NumPy I'm going to build a Neural Network from scracth that classifies Hand Written Digits. Throught the project you will be able to find the Neural Network Architecture, Forward Progagation, Backward Propagation, Gradient Descent, the Accuracy of the Neural Network and the Predictions of the Hand Written Digits
